# Default proxy configuration.
#
default_proxy:

  # Loose-Routing.
  # For initial INVITE, SUBSCRIBE and REFER requests the proxy adds Record-Route header(s).
  # For REGISTER requests the proxy adds Path header(s).
  # By default _yes_.
  #
  do_loose_routing: yes

  # Enable DNS cache. By default _yes_.
  #
  use_dns_cache: yes

  # DNS cache time (in seconds). A DNS result is removed from the cache after the given time.
  # Minimum value is 300. Default value is 300.
  #
  dns_cache_time: 300

  # Use DNS NAPTR. If set, NAPTR query is performed when URI host is a domain, has no port nor
  # ;transport param.
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  use_naptr: yes

  # Use DNS SRV. If set, SRV query is performed when URI host is a domain and has no port,
  # If this is set to _no_ then _use_naptr_ is also set to _no_.
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  use_srv: yes

  # Transport preference. The list of supported transports in order of preference.
  # When there is NAPTR record, its SRV records are tryed in this order just in the case
  # _force_transport_preference_ is _yes_.
  # If there is not NAPTR record, SRV records are then tryed in this order.
  # Valid transports are "udp", "tcp" and "tls".
  # Default value is ["tls", "tcp", "udp"] (first try "tls").
  #
  transport_preference: ["tls", "tcp", "udp"]

  # Force transport preference. If _no_, transport preference is taken from NAPTR records
  # (when present). If _yes_, transport preferences are taken from transport_preference
  # parameter even for NAPTR records.
  # Default value is _no_.
  #
  force_transport_preference: no

  # IP type preference. When both IPv4 and IPv6 are available, this parameter determines
  # whether to try first DNS A or AAAA queries. It also determines the IP type this proxy
  # is allowed to use for routing requests.
  # Valid IP types are "ipv4" and "ipv6".
  # Default value is ["ipv4", "ipv6"] (first try "ipv4").
  #
  ip_type_preference: ["ipv4", "ipv6"]

  # DNS failover on received 503.
  # RFC 3261 section 16.7 "Response Processing" states that a proxy receiving a 503 MUST
  # convert it into a 500 (unless certain cases). We make it optional.
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  dns_failover_on_503: yes

  # INVITE transaction timeout timer (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a provisional or final response.
  # Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 64.
  # Default value is 32.
  #
  timer_B: 32

  # Proxy INVITE transaction timeout timer (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a final response.
  # Minimum value is 8, maximum value is 180.
  # Default value is 120.
  #
  timer_C: 120

  # Non-INVITE transaction timeout timer (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a final response.
  # Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 64.
  # Default value is 32.
  #
  timer_F: 32

  # Validate TLS certificate from the contacted server (just when using TLS transport).
  # If set to _yes_, the contacted server MUST present a valid certificate. The connection
  # will be inmediately closed otherwise and a 500 error locally generated.
  # NOTE: This does not match the SIP request destination host agains the hosts asserted by
  # the certificate. This just performs TLS certificate pure validation.
  # Default value is _no_.
  tls_validation: no


# Proxy configuration for routing in-dialog requests.
#
proxy_in_dialog:

  use_dns: yes
  use_dns_cache: yes
  dns_cache_time: 300
  use_naptr: no
  use_srv: no
  timer_B: 32
  timer_C: 60
  timer_F: 32


# Proxy configuration for routing initial requests to clients.
proxy_to_users:

  use_dns: no
  dns_failover_on_503: no
  timer_B: 32
  timer_F: 32


# Proxy configuration for routing initial requests to the external world.
